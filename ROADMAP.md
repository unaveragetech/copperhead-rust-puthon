# Copperhead Roadmap

What we're building next.

---

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

**The full compilation pipeline is verified working.** Python source code is parsed, transpiled to Rust with PyO3 bindings, compiled via Cargo, and produces a `.dll`/`.so` file.

**Working:**
- Full type system (16 primitive types, 4 collection types, 2 ownership types)
- AST parser with type extraction and RPB detection
- Rust transpiler with PyO3 0.23 bindings (supports Python 3.13)
- Compiler pipeline: Python → AST → Rust → Cargo → `.dll`/`.so`
- CLI with 10 commands
- AI agent with Ollama integration (verified with real models)
- Module registry with SQLite (13 pre-loaded examples)
- Debugger with syntax/type/pattern/safety checks
- Interactive interpreter (shared workspace for user+AI)
- 179 unit tests + 52 comprehensive integration tests (all passing)
- Package builds and publishes to PyPI

**Verified on:**
- Python 3.13.3
- Rust 1.89.0 / Cargo 1.89.0
- PyO3 0.23.5
- Windows 11 (also targets Linux/macOS)
